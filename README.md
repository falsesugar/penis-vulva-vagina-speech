# Penis? Vulva? Vagina?
by Tina Rungsawang, for ITP 2020

Screaming "PENIS!" in public places and drawing cartoon penises on practically every surface have long been a part of our culture. But what about the vulva? What if every time someone says PENIS, a vulva appears instead? Or we can also just start saying VULVA and VAGINA too! It's time to normalize the sacred feminine part <3
